# 32-bit RISC-V CPU

A 32-bit RISC-V processor design project using Verilog HDL, focused on digital logic, datapath design, instruction decoding, and processor verification.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a 32-bit RISC-V CPU from foundational digital logic and arithmetic components to a functioning processor. It builds on concepts explored through Nand2Tetris while targeting the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA).

**Status:** In development. The complete processor has not yet been documented as integrated and verified.

## Repository Contents

The public repository currently contains:

- `Project1/` — Foundational combinational logic components.
- `Project2/` — Arithmetic and ALU-related components.
- `Project3/` — Sequential logic and memory-related components.
- `run_test.bat` — Windows batch script for running tests.
- `.gitignore` — Git ignore configuration.

Additional 32-bit CPU components developed locally have not yet been uploaded and reviewed as part of the public repository.

## Development Goals

- Develop and verify 32-bit datapath components.
- Implement the ALU, register file, program counter, and immediate-generation logic.
- Design instruction decoding and control logic for the intended RISC-V instruction subset.
- Integrate the datapath, control unit, and memory interfaces.
- Test individual modules and instruction execution through simulation.
- Explore synthesis and FPGA implementation where practical.

## Planned Workflow

1. Review the existing Verilog modules and testbenches.
2. Validate and improve the test-running workflow.
3. Reconcile locally developed CPU components with the public repository.
4. Define and document the supported RISC-V instructions.
5. Integrate the processor and verify its behavior.
6. Document simulation results and hardware implementation, if completed.

## Tools and Technologies

- **HDL:** Verilog
- **Simulation:** Icarus Verilog
- **Waveform analysis:** GTKWave
- **Version control:** Git and GitHub

## Verification

Module-level and processor-level verification will be documented as testing is completed. No instruction support, integration milestone, or simulation result is considered complete without corresponding implementation and verification.
